Environement variables :
------------------------

$DECALS_DATA_DIR
$DECALS_RANDOM_DIR
$PYTS_DIR
$PYTS_DATA_DIR

../decals 			:	contains the tractor catalogs of DR1
../decalsDepthMasks	:	contains the depths masks
../starMasks		:	contains the bright star masks. Currently the mask cover part of stripe 82 that was observed by decals. To be finalized for the complete footprint.
../decalsRandoms	:	contains randoms points where decals already observed
../decalsSelections	:	contains the selection done with this package
../decals_cutouts	:	contains cutouts around the targets (work in progress)



Library :
---------

lib_select_ELG.py

contains the different functions necessary to do a selection on the DECaLS photometric survey:
 * getCompleteness 	: get the completeness values for a list of ra and dec in a brick
 * selectELG_240 	: selects the ELGs from a brick to a completeness limit in grz with the fiducial 240 algorithm 
 * selectRandoms	: selects the randoms from a brick to a completeness limit in grz
 * selectELG_280 	: selects the ELGs from a brick to a completeness limit in grz with the new 280 algorithm (still under tests)
 * selectLRG_DESI	: selects LRG-CMASS using grzW1. Test for DESI by Ginevra Favole.


Scripts :
---------

* make_ELG_240_catalog.py :: constructs the ELG catalog selected with the ELG 240 algorithm.
* concatenate_ELG_240_catalog.sh :: creates the master ELG catalog from the bricks catalogs.

* maskELGcatalog.py :: adds a column to the ELG catalog that tells if a target is included or not in a mangle mask. Used to mask for bright stars

* make_GeneralRandom_Catalog.py :: produced the randoms on a brick per brick basis : ../decalsRandoms  To be run only once at each data release.

Dependencies :
==============

stilts.jar 	: 	a java library to handle large fits catalogs rapidly

MASKING :
=========
the mask flag takes different values corresponding to the
different masks applied :
N= 1  stands for mask= ../starMasks/tycho2mask-0Vmag10.pol
N= 2  stands for mask= ../starMasks/tycho2mask-10Vmag11.pol
N= 3  stands for mask= ../starMasks/tycho2mask-115Vmag12.pol
N= 4  stands for mask= ../starMasks/tycho2mask-11Vmag115.pol
